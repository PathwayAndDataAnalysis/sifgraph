# SIF graph representation and querying support
This library provides a Java object model for SIF graphs, as well as a graph querying support and some I/O functions.

Please see the [workflow example](https://github.com/PathwayCommons/sifgraph/blob/master/src/test/java/org/pathwaycommons/sif/WorkflowExample.java#L26) for a quick start.
